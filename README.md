# Blazor Wedding

This is my first Blazor App using my wedding as inspiration.

[![My Skills](https://skills.thijs.gg/icons?i=dotnet,html,css,visualstudio,cs,azure)](https://skills.thijs.gg)

## Deployment

I'm currently hosting this on Azure Free App Service.

> [!NOTE]
> I won't provide the link to it or plan to deploy it afterwards. Once the wedding will be done, I'll remove all personnal data and open the  repo to public.



## Installation

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexandreBaptiste/WASMHostedBlazorWedding.git
```

Either do what you want with Microsoft Visual Studio 

Or 

```bash
nuget restore Wedding.sln

dotnet build

dotnet run
```
## Features
